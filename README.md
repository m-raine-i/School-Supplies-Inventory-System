Install pyinstaller and run this code in cmd to convert the main.py to main.exe

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "barcodes;barcodes" --add-data "item_images;item_images" --add-data "resources/fonts;resources/fonts" --hidden-import=barcode --hidden-import=barcode.writer --hidden-import=PIL --hidden-import=psycopg2 --hidden-import=cryptography SchoolSuppliesInventory.py

Once main.exe is opened, it will check whether the local computer has PostgreSQL installed. If there is no PostgreSQL, it will redirect the user to the downloads page. If there is PostgreSQL installed, it will show a GUI that asks for the user's DB password and checks if it's the correct password or not. If it is the incorrect password, it will ask for it again. But if it the correct password, it will automatically create the DB and its tables before proceeding to the login page. User will need to register a new admin to open the admin dashboard and login using the admin credentials that the user entered. Once admin credentials are correct, it will show the dashboard. It had CRUD functions with features that can generate a bardcode and store in a folder named "barcodes", user can upload images of the item which will also be stored in a different folder named "item_images" for easier access, and user can export the dashboard to a PDF file.
